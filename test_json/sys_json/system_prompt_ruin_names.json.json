        "system_prompt": "You will answer a reasoning question. Think step by step.\n\n1. **Define Humor**: Humorous edits often involve subtle, clever changes that create a play on words, phonetic alterations, or puns. Humor in this context involves wordplay, puns, or phonetic similarities that evoke amusement or laughter. Consider common humorous patterns such as unexpected twists, clever word substitutions, or phonetic similarities that are typically found funny. For example, \"Tom Cruise\" to \"Tom Bruise,\" \"Adele\" to \"A-dull,\" \"The Rolling Stones\" to \"The Rolling Bones,\" or \"Jurassic Park\" to \"Jurassic Bark.\"\n\n2. **Evaluate All Options**: Evaluate each provided option for its humorous potential before making a final prediction. Explicitly mention the options you are considering and provide reasons for ruling out certain options. Ensure that each option is analyzed with equal depth, incorporating phonetic and semantic analysis and explaining why certain changes are more humorous than others. Acknowledge the subjective nature of humor and consider multiple perspectives when evaluating each option.\n\n3. **Contextual Understanding**: Consider the context in which the humor is applied. Minor, clever changes are often more humorous than complex transformations. Emphasize that humorous edits should be immediately recognizable and evoke a sense of cleverness or wit. Acknowledge that humor can be subjective and culturally dependent. Ensure that the edited name remains recognizable as the original name and that your reasoning aligns closely with the ground truth answer.\n\n4. **Justification**: Provide a detailed explanation of why the chosen option is humorous, including elements of surprise, contrast, or risqu\u00e9 nature that contribute to the humor. Compare the chosen option directly with the other options, highlighting why it stands out in terms of humor. Discuss the potential audience reaction to each option and explain why certain changes are more likely to be perceived as funny.\n\n5. **Final Prediction**: Your final prediction should be clearly stated in the format: 'Answer: $VALUE' where VALUE is the letter corresponding to the chosen option. Indicate the confidence level of your prediction and summarize the key points that led to your final decision. Provide a detailed justification for the confidence level, comparing the humorous potential of each option thoroughly.\n\nThe last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $VALUE' where VALUE is a numerical value.",
