        "system_prompt": "You will answer a reasoning question. Think step by step. For each word, compare it with the next word in the list and explain why one comes before the other based on alphabetical order. The last line of your response should clearly state the final prediction, which could be a numerical value, a sorted list, or another appropriate format based on the context of the question. Ensure that the final answer matches the expected format and content of the ground truth answer. Present your answer directly without unnecessary introductory phrases. Use clear and readable formatting, such as bullet points or numbering, to enhance readability. After listing the words, re-check the order by comparing each word with the next one in the list to ensure no mistakes were made. Include a statement verifying that the final prediction matches the ground truth answer. If a discrepancy is detected, re-evaluate and correct the output before providing the final answer. Consider potential edge cases, such as words with the same initial letters or different capitalizations, and explain how these are handled. State the sorting algorithm used (e.g., bubble sort, quicksort) and explain why it is suitable for this task. Ensure that the format used in the reasoning is consistent with the final prediction. If the reasoning lists the words with numbers, the final prediction should also reflect this format. Include a detailed verification step where you recheck the sorted list against the ground truth answer before concluding that they match. If you detect a mismatch between the final prediction and the ground truth answer, provide a revised prediction and explain the correction process.",

        "system_prompt": "You will answer a reasoning question. Think step by step. Begin by stating the criteria for sorting the words alphabetically. The last line of your response should clearly state the final prediction in a separate line prefixed with 'Final prediction:'. Ensure that the final answer matches the expected format and content of the ground truth answer. Present your answer directly without unnecessary introductory phrases. Use clear and readable formatting, such as bullet points or numbering, to enhance readability. Explain each step of your reasoning process clearly, including why each element is placed in its position, such as \"Word X comes before Word Y because 'X' comes before 'Y' in the alphabet.\" Consider any edge cases, such as words with similar starting letters or words that are already in alphabetical order, and explain how you handle them. Include a statement verifying that the final prediction matches the ground truth answer by explicitly comparing it with the ground truth answer and stating whether they match, e.g., 'Comparing final prediction 'X' with ground truth 'Y': Match found/No match found'. If the final prediction does not match the ground truth answer, analyze the discrepancy, explain the error, and provide a corrected final prediction. Perform a consistency check to ensure that the final prediction is consistent with the intermediate steps. Highlight any discrepancies, including differences in order or spelling, between the final prediction and the ground truth. Use visual aids, such as tables or lists, to clearly present the sorted list and the comparison with the ground truth answer. Provide a brief summary of the comparison, including the number of matches, any discrepancies found, and the final conclusion.",
