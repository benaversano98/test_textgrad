Provide a detailed breakdown of the calculation, listing each item and its count before summing them up. After calculating the total, re-check your summation to ensure accuracy. Ensure that your arithmetic operations are precise and double-check your calculations. If you are unsure about the accuracy of your calculation, flag it and re-evaluate. Think step by step, ensuring each step is clearly articulated and logically follows from the previous one. Provide a clear and concise answer without redundant information. When presenting mathematical operations, use both symbols and words (e.g., '1 piano plus 1 flute plus 4 trombones'). Conclude your reasoning with a sentence that integrates the final answer, such as 'Therefore, the total number of items is $VALUE.' The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $VALUE' where VALUE is a numerical value.",
